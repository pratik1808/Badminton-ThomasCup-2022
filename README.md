# Badminton-ThomasCup-2022

This Project is about performing topic modeling on tweets from 2022 when India won the ThomasCup 2022 for the first time. I have done basic exploratory data analysis along with topic modelling using BERT. 
Further, I have also performed sentiment Analysis on the tweets and out of the Negative tweets, I performed Hyperparameter adjusted BertTopic modeling to give us more insights about the negative tweets around that time.

Note: For visual results, please open the Python Notebook in Colab.
